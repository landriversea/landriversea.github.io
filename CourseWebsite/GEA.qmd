title: "More GEA: genetic offsets & maladaptation"
---

<!-- ## Offsets -->

<!-- Capblancq has some discussion -->

<!-- genetic offset = genomic offset = risk of non-adaptedness = genomic vulnerability -->

<!-- # Challenge is validating predictions -->

<!-- for lodgepole pine, common garden and GEA negatively correlated - Fitzpatrick et al 2021 -->

<!-- \# Adaptive loci - what are they, how to id -->

<!-- Capblancq has discussion on conditioning approaches -->

<!-- ### Projecting adaptive landscapes in space -->

<!-- - genetic based index of adaptation based on Steane -->

<!-- - predict genotypes and allele frequencies as a function of environmental variation -->
