title: "Basic Bash"
---

This module is an introduction to bash, covering the most basic concepts. For those that are new to bash, we recommend trying out an online tutorial for bash for beginners prior to the course in addition to this, for instance [https://evomics.org/learning/unix-tutorial/Links](https://evomics.org/learning/unix-tutorial/)

Those with Windows computers will also need to prepare to be able to use a terminal on their computers, we provide background instructions \[in the attached document\].

The module will consist in a lecture and an exercise. We will also hand out IDs and give instructions for logging on to the Lund University server that will be used for all bash based teaching during this session.
