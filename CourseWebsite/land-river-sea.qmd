# What is landscape genomics?

(landscape = any habitat)

> "At the heart of spatial and space--time analysis of population genetics is the connection between observed spatial patterns and the space--time processes that generate them." - Epperson 2003

> "the interaction between landscape features and microevolutionary processes, such as gene ﬂow, genetic drift and selection." - Manel et al 2003

> Landscape genetics tests the model that $G \sim f(E)$ - Dyer 2015, Molecular Ecology

## Is landscape *genomics* fundamentally different from landscape *genetics*?

No, just swap "genetics" for "genomics" - Balkenhol et al 2016

Yes - "Whereas landscape genetics studies primarily focus on testing the effects of landscape variables on gene ﬂow and genetic population structure, landscape genomics studies focus on detecting candidate genes under selection that indicate possible local adaptation." - Storfer et al 2018

**What do *you* think?**

In this course, we will focus on a few topics in landscape genomics aiming to give you a solid foundation in the field. We will not be comprehensive but will try to point out important topics when we encounter them. There is a stronger emphasis on population genomics and various landscapes (especially marine) in this course than might be found in other landscape genomic courses. Look at the optional readings as suggestions on how to learn more about various topics.

**What are we covering and why?**

-   Making maps and using spatial data

-   Describing genetic variation and genetic structuring

-   RDA as a flexible tool

-   Simulations and demographic analyses

-   Resistance surfaces

-   Projecting into the future with generalised dissimilarity modelling, gradient forests

-   Biophysical models of dispersal

-   More genotype-environmenta asociations and genomic offsets

-   (Time permitting) Landscape genomics and genetic architectures

**Some important topics we will not cover very much/at all**

-   Sampling design

-   Tests of selection

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Activity 1

Make a poster of your study system - no one will be judged for their artistry!

Your poster needs to include information on your organism and your landscape.

-   What are the important spatial aspects of your landscape?

-   Are there critical genomic elements to your study?

-   What is the overarching question or hypothesis?

-   (Don't forget to add your name!)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Unifying elements of landscape genomics

Fundamentally there are three main steps to any landscape genetic/genomic study:

1.  Describe spatial variability

2.  Describe genetic variability

3.  Use statistics to look for correlations between spatial and genetic attributes.

(Recommended by rarely done: independent corroboration/validation)

(Optional - very popular recently, predict adaptive matching to future environments, genomic offsets)

![LG overview - Rellstab et al. 2015](images/Study_desligns_Rellstab_etal_2015.png)

## Spatial variable attributes

(that often violate statistical assumptions)

![Attributes of spatial variables - Riginos et al. 2016](images/spatial_attribute_Riginos_etal_2016.png)

![Various spatial variables for Northern Europe - Riginos et al 2016](images/Europe_variables_Riginos_etal_2016.png)

![Scales of autocorrelation with Moran's I - Riginos et al 2016](images/Autocorrelation_scales_Riginos_etal_2016.png)

![Using PCA biplot to visualise correlations - Riginos et al 2016](images/Corellations_Riginos_etal_2016.png)

Other factors to consider -

-   What is the grain size of your spatial variables?
-   Are spatial variables site specific or gridded (remote sensing)?

![Remote sensing products may have a biologically irrelevant grain size](images/Spatial_grain_size.png)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Activity 2

Consider three basic habitat types: terrestrial, marine, freshwater

-   What spatial factors affect dispersal, either blocking or facilitating?

-   What spatial factors affect population sizes?

-   What environmental factors are likely to have been important agents of selection within species' ranges over [evolutionary time]{.underline}?

-   Under historical conditions, what is the time frame of the above spatial factors? (thousands of years, tens of years, months, days...)

-   How have human activities modified any of the above factors (spatially, temporally)?

-   (For all of these questions you might decide to break their effects down by different taxonomic groups)

# Describing relationships between sampling sites

## Relationship of LG to landscape ecology

Many of the methods used in landscape genetics/genomics have their origins in spatial (landscape) ecology.

-   Methods papers and supporting documentation for analyses are likely to have species as the unit of inference - usually you can replace "species" with "loci"

-   Also, get used to thinking about genetic diversity in terms of alpha and beta diversity

-   Methodological inspirations for landscape genomics often come from landscape genetics, especially for describing spatial structure. Searching this literature for solutions and inspiration can be fruitful.

-   Tools borrowed from landscape ecology help move between different types of data and analyses

Alpha and beta diversity:

Statistical models for representing relationships among and between locations:

![Statistical models - Wagner & Fortin 2016](images/statisticalModels_Wagner_Fortin_2016.png)

## GEAs: Genotype-by-environment associations

( = environmental associations)

1.  Genome-wide: related to demographic history, ecological speciation/diversification, isolation by environment

![Processes leading to IBE - Wang & Bradburd 2014](images/IsolationByEnvironment1-Wang_and_Bradburd_2014.png)

![IBE signals - Wang & Bradburd 2014](images/IsolationByEnvironment2-Wang_and_Bradburd_2014.png)

Tutorial on RDAs, GDM, and GF mostly sit in this category.

2.  Finding loci contribute to heritable genetic variation of selected traits

![Rellstab et al 2015 (Image modified from Sork et al 2013)](images/environment_genotype_phenotype_Rellstab2015.png)

There is a huge literature on the topic of finding candidate loci for environmental selection that we cannot cover in one week. Population genetic tests of selection such as *outlier tests* or *genomic scans* are frequently used. There are also tests of selection that specifically look for associations of individual loci to environmental attributes - often called *GEA, genotype-environment association* or *EAA, environment association analysis* - this will be more of our focus given that we are studying landscape genomics. We will come back to this topic on Friday. (Rellstab et al. 2015 and Storfer et al 2018 have good reviews of the various methods if you are looking for further reading on this topic.)

# Sampling strategies and goals

Key questions:

-   Is your study exploratory or testing specific hypotheses?

Exploratory

-   Try to sample across the landscape

    -   Random

    -   Stratified (break up spatial correlations among environmental variables)

    -   Across "hotspots" of environmental turnover

Hypothesis testing

-   Interested in one environmental variable?

    -   Pairs or gradients (but look at co-varying environmental factors, apply stratification concepts)

-   Candidate loci have been independently identified?

    -   What is the relevant environmental variable and can you design sampling to break up correlations with other variables (stratification, again)?

(In reality, most landscape genomic studies sample opportunistically and try to deal with spatial correlations at the analytical stage.)

![Sampling for different purposes - Rellstab et al 2015](images/Detail_Rellstab_etal_2015.png)

**Only 3.4% of studies have used paired sampling!** (Dauphin et al 2023)

## Conceptual example of stratified sampling

![Stratified sampling - Liggins et al 2019](images/StratifiedSampling1_Liggins_etal_2019.png)

![Stratified sampling - Liggins et al 2019](images/StratifiedSampling2_Liggins_etal_2019.png)

## Sampling across shifts in multidimensional environments for exploratory studies

!["Hotspots" of environmental change - Riginos et al 2016](images/Environmental_shifting_hotspots_Riginos_etal_2016.png)

# Ubiquitous problems in LG

-   Methods are biased to find few genes of large effect and yet most traits are likely polygenic
-   Outlier methods are biased to find false positives when there is underlying population structure
-   Collinearity of environmental variables makes moving from association to causation impossible without experiments

A more detailed workflow:

# Activity 3

Update your poster in light of the class discussions.

Is your study exploratory or hypothesis testing?

Could you modify your study design to align to your goals?
