# Genotype Environment Associations

What are they

# Why RDA and other multivariate methods?

| Predictive variables | Response variables | Appropriate family of methods \* |
|---------------------|-------------------|--------------------------------|
| One                  | One                | Univariate/Simple regression     |
| Many                 | One                | Multiple regression              |
| Many                 | Many               | Multivariate regression          |

\* Note that your genetic data not conform to expectations of standard methods including independence

Ordination allows

-   Compression and visualisation of complex data

-   Flexibility to move between distances (between populations or individuals) and Euclidean genetic distances

-   Flexibility to use allele frequencies (populations) or genotypes (individuals)

-   RDA performs well in genotype environment association analyses with low false positives and high true positives

Pitfalls on using ordination with genetic data

-   Missing observations need to be excluded or imputed

-   Uneven sampling can skew results

-   It is pattern description: many processes can yield the same patterns

## Review of ordination, PCA & PCoA

## Constrained ordination as implemented in RDA

-   Flexible

RDA can address the following questions (citing Capblancq et al. 2021):

1.  What environmental/spatial processes drive patterns of genetic variation?

2\. What is the genetic basis of local adaptation to the environment?

3\. How is adaptive genetic variation distributed across landscapes?

4\. What are the impacts of climate and/or landscape change on the distribution of adaptive genetic variation?

RDA takes linear combinations of the explanatory variables (X) and uses them to maximise the variance explained in linear combinations of Y (where X and Y are matrices)

-   Keep this linearity in mind: it might not be appropriate for your data

## Data preparation

get environmental variables

standardize - mean of 0, SD = 1

can include dummy predictors (0/1)

-   explain when more than two categories

look for colinearity - need to define and explain VIF

### Variable selection with forward model building

Builds up a predictive model and assists with variable reduction

1.  Test significance of *global model* (= all variables)

2.  Start with "empty" model (= intercept only) and sequentially add variables

3.  Two stopping criteria to avoid overfitting - end with either criterion

    -   permutation based significance test

    -   adjusted $R^2$ from global model

    -   

### Variance partitioning using partial RDA

Allows independent estimation of sets of variables together with confounded effects caused by collinearity

![Reporting on partial RDA-From Capblancq et al. 2021](images/partialRDA__Capblancq_etal2021.png){fig-align="center"}

Define the different proportions

? make MCQ check

### Adaptive loci - what are they, how to id

Capblancq has discussion on conditioning approaches

### Projecting adaptive landscapes in space

-   genetic based index of adaptation based on Steane

-   predict geneotpyes and allele frequencies as a function of enviromental variation
